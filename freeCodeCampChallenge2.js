/**
 Today's challenge is inspired by the release of ChatGPT on November 30, 2022.

Given a string of one or more sentences, determine if it was likely generated by AI using the following rules:

It contains two or more dashes (-).

It contains two or more sets of parenthesis (()). Text can be within the parenthesis.

It contains three or more words with 7 or more letters.

Words are separated by a single space and only consist of letters (A-Z). Don't include punctuation or other non-letters as part of a word.

If the given sentence meets any of the rules above, return "AI", otherwise, return "Human".

1. detectAI("The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.") should return "Human".
Waiting:2. detectAI("The hypersonic brown fox - jumped (over) the lazy dog.") should return "Human".
Waiting:3. detectAI("Yes - you're right! I made a mistake there - let me try again.") should return "AI".
Waiting:4. detectAI("The extraordinary students were studying vivaciously.") should return "AI".
Waiting:5. detectAI("The (excited) student was (coding) in the library.") should return "AI".

  let paragraph = "This is the first sentence. And this is the second! Is this the third?";
let sentences = paragraph.split(/(?<=[.!?])\s//); // Splits by . ! ? followed by optional space

/*for (let sentence of sentences) {
    console.log(sentence.trim()); // Outputs each sentence, trimmed
}

// Or using forEach
sentences.forEach((sentence, index) => {
    console.log(`Sentence ${index + 1}: ${sentence.trim()}`);
});

2. Looping through Words:
To iterate over individual words, you can split the string into an array of words and then loop through the array:
JavaScript

let sentence = "This is a sample sentence.";
let words = sentence.split(' '); // Splits by space
for (let word of words) {
    console.log(word); // Outputs each word
}
For more robust word splitting, especially when dealing with punctuation, you might use a regular expression with match():
JavaScript

let sentence = "Hello, world! How are you?";
let words = sentence.match(/\b\w+\b/g); // Matches whole words
if (words) {
    for (let word of words) {
        console.log(word); // Outputs words without punctuation
    }
}
    1. Looping through Characters (Text):
To iterate over individual characters within a string, you can use: for loop.
JavaScript

    let text = "Hello";
    for (let i = 0; i < text.length; i++) {
        console.log(text[i]); // Outputs each character
    }
for...of loop.
JavaScript

    let text = "Hello";
    for (let char of text) {
        console.log(char); // Outputs each character
    }
split('') and forEach().
JavaScript

    let text = "Hello";
    text.split('').forEach(char => {
        console.log(char); // Outputs each character
    });
 */

function detectiveAI (text) {
  let textLen = text.split(' ') //this splits the sentence in to words
  textLen = textLen.split("")
  let word = [];
  textLen.forEach(char => {
    word.push(char);
    word.forEach((letter, i) => {
        if(word[i]  === '(' && word[i] === word[i]){text = "AI"}
        else if(word[i]  === ')' && word[i] === word[i]){text = "AI"}
        else if(word[i]  === '-' && word[i] === word[i]){text = "AI"}
        else if (word.length >= 7){text = "AI"} else{ text = 'Human'}
        console.log(word)
    });
  });
  return text;
}

//console.log( detectiveAI("The hypersonic brown fox - jumped (over) the lazy dog.")) //should return "Human".
